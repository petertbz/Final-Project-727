	abstract = {The global industrial structure and trade patterns have changed significantly with the full penetration of digital information technology into social and economic life. The digital economy has become a core driving force for global economic growth, and the development of the digital economy has gradually become the consensus of all economies in the world. The article breaks through the traditional perspective to understand the digital economy. It proposes that economic factors drive the digital world's development, digital knowledge and information are the critical production factors of the digital economy, and the digital economy wealth is concentrated in a few platform companies' hands. In the digital economy era, the business ecology is experiencing innovative destruction, the real economy and retail industry are suffering heavy losses, while the information industry and digital platforms are ushering in explosive growth. Based on natural ecology principles, the article deconstructs and analyzes the digital business ecology, and proposes business development strategies such as maintaining the diversification of business forms, promoting digital empowering the real economy, the digital transformation of the real economy and digital industrialization. The article discusses platform monopoly and competition, including platform characteristics analysis, economic causes, anti-monopoly investigation cases, and the relationship between monopoly, innovation, and competition. The authorities must not ignore behaviours that harm market competition due to competition's dynamic nature and develop digital economy tolerantly and prudently, maintaining the economic ecology's diversity and balance.},
