	abstract = {Background: Vaccination is a cornerstone of the prevention of communicable infectious diseases; however, vaccines have traditionally met with public fear and hesitancy, and COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines.
Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals.
Methods: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon.
Results: Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2\%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90\% effective.
Conclusions: Public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines.},

	abstract = {When a concentrated market for differentiated products exhibits dynamic demand effects due to inertia, contagion, or network externalities, forward-looking firms consider the strategic impact of investment, pricing, and other conduct that can tip the market by grabbing market share. When the contested market provides a line of defense for a more lucrative core market, a firm can have a powerful strategic incentive to capture and control the contested market, as a ‘‘loss leader’’ if necessary. We use this framework to analyze the browser war between Netscape and Microsoft. Adopting a Markov Perfect Equilibrium model to capture firms’ strategic behavior, we discuss the steps needed for such analysis. We compare as-is market trajectories with but-for trajectories under a counterfactual without ‘‘anticompetitive acts’’ deemed in violation of anti-trust law. Our empirical analysis uses incomplete and noisy public data. Consequently, specifications and results should be viewed only as illustrating the method in a highly parametrized model with restrictions that might not be robust. Access to complete and confidential firm data would result in a less restricted model with potentially different results.},

	abstract = {The global industrial structure and trade patterns have changed significantly with the full penetration of digital information technology into social and economic life. The digital economy has become a core driving force for global economic growth, and the development of the digital economy has gradually become the consensus of all economies in the world. The article breaks through the traditional perspective to understand the digital economy. It proposes that economic factors drive the digital world's development, digital knowledge and information are the critical production factors of the digital economy, and the digital economy wealth is concentrated in a few platform companies' hands. In the digital economy era, the business ecology is experiencing innovative destruction, the real economy and retail industry are suffering heavy losses, while the information industry and digital platforms are ushering in explosive growth. Based on natural ecology principles, the article deconstructs and analyzes the digital business ecology, and proposes business development strategies such as maintaining the diversification of business forms, promoting digital empowering the real economy, the digital transformation of the real economy and digital industrialization. The article discusses platform monopoly and competition, including platform characteristics analysis, economic causes, anti-monopoly investigation cases, and the relationship between monopoly, innovation, and competition. The authorities must not ignore behaviours that harm market competition due to competition's dynamic nature and develop digital economy tolerantly and prudently, maintaining the economic ecology's diversity and balance.},
